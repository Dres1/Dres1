- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dres1
- 👀 I’m interested in changing career paths.  I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a Math minor.  I recently concluded tutoring someone through 
- a CS/Math minor bachelor's degree.  I've tutored before (chess, math) and have realized that the best way to learn is to teach.  The recent tutoring exercise took
- six years because the student is a full time Project Manager and was taking two classes per semester.  Especially during the pandemic where classes were asynchronous,
- I was able to directly absorb all of the content and have an understanding equivalent to someone graduating with a bachelor's in CS.  My student graduated in May of 22'.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github and how to actually effect a career change since coding makes me happy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really.  I'd love to gain even more experience coding a solving problems.
- 📫 How to reach me:  by email at castaneda.andres1@hotmail.com
